# 🔐 Design and Implementation of a Password Security System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a password security system designed using digital logic gates, BCD decoders, seven-segment displays, and LEDs. The system verifies a 4-digit password and provides visual and audio feedback using LEDs and a buzzer.

## 🧠 Theory of Operation
- The system compares user input with a predefined password (last four digits of registration number).
- Input is entered through binary signals interpreted via logic gates.
- Correct password ➝ Green LED ON.
- Incorrect password ➝ Red LED and buzzer activated.
- Entered password is shown via seven-segment display in real time.

## 🧰 Components Used
- 4-input AND gates
- NOT gates
- BCD decoder IC
- 7-segment display
- LEDs (Red & Green)
- Buzzer
- Breadboard & wiring
- Power supply

## 🛠️ Design Process
1. Logic expressions were derived for each password digit.
2. Gates connected according to the binary password.
3. NOT gates used to invert signals where needed.
4. BCD decoder linked to 7-segment for visual feedback.
5. LEDs and buzzer added for output indicators.

## 📋 Results
- Correct password activates green LED.
- Incorrect password activates red LED and buzzer.
- Display reflects entered digits in real time.

## ✅ Conclusion
This project serves as a foundational demonstration of digital logic implementation in hardware-based security systems, highlighting password checking, visual alerts, and logic design using Proteus.
